  <h3>Development stages of NIIT</h3>
  <p>
    NIIT University, Neemarana
    In 2004, NIIT hived off its software business into an independent
    organization called NIIT Technologies Ltd.
    (Source: NASSCOM’s 2013-14 Ranking of Top 20 IT services companies). 
    In the area of training, NIIT launched its ‘Edgeineers’ program in 2005, 
    to boost career opportunities for engineering graduates. In the same year, 
    it diversified into various sectors such as banking, finance and insurance (through IFBI), Executive Management
    education (through Imperia), Professional Life Skills, BPM, and ICT education for schools. 
    In 2008, NIIT set up NIIT University, in Neemrana, Rajasthan. NU, offers B-Tech and M-Tech programs 
    in computer science and education technology, as well as MBA programs. In 2014, NIIT tied up with National
    Skill Development Corporation to launch NIIT Yuva Jyoti centers, under the pilot phase of Prime Minister
    Narendra Modi’s Skill India campaign and the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) in North East, J&K and Jharkhand.

  <h2>Achievements of NIIT</h2>
  <p>
    In 1988, NIIT introduced many marketing and advertising 
    strategies for the Indian market including the ‘Computerdrome’
    in 1990.[8] Another initiative launched by NIIT, was its Bhavishya
    Jyoti Scholarships program, launched in 1991,[9] which was targeted
    at deserving and socially challenged students with an aim to improve
    their skills and employability quotient. In 1992, NIIT launched its
    flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month 
    Professional Practice for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. 
    By 1993, NIIT began trading NIIT stocks on the Indian stock exchanges. 
    In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in Hong Kong. 
    In the same year, the company launched its virtual university ‘Net Varsity’. 
    In 1998, NIIT joined a handful of Indian tech companies to enter the Chinese market. 
    The company earned the epithet, the ‘McDonald’s of the software business’ by Far Eastern Economic 
    Review in September, 2001.[10] The same year, NIIT launched an experiment that was christened ‘Hole-in-the-Wall’ 
    by media and drew international attention. The experiment was based on the ‘minimally invasive education’ methodology
    developed by NIIT R&D. It suggested that children, irrespective of their social, ethnic or educational identity could
    learn to use computers by themselves, without adult intervention. In 2003, NIIT launched its MindChampions Academy 
    (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand, five-time former World Chess champion and NIIT Brand Ambassador..
